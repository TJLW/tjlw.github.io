## Welcome

I am currently a graduate student studying computer engineering though I still thoroughly enjoy almost every aspect of computing systems. To satisfy my broad interests, FPGAs have been central in all my undertakings and have allowed me to research high level software frameworks like, ROS and ArduPilot, running on custom Linux kernels as well as develop custom hardware and associating firmware for these systems.

This page is an attempt to collect some of the work I have taken part in and be a
better member of the open-source community.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TJLW/tjlw.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TJLW/tjlw.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
